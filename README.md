# AI in HR: Exploring Autogen's Capabilities

Welcome to the official repository accompanying our YouTube video, "Does Autogen's AI Spell the End for Traditional HR? Unpacking the Shift." This repository provides additional resources, scripts, and documentation to help you further understand and explore the capabilities of Microsoft's Autogen and its application in Human Resources.

## Video Overview
In this video, we take a deep dive into how Artificial Intelligence, particularly Microsoft's Autogen, is transforming HR. We explore a multi-agent group chat with bots, and demonstrate a real-world use case for planning capacity in 2024, showcasing how AI can step in to replace the roles of a people analyst and a recruiting leader. Additionally, we discuss future implications and potential developments in AI-powered HR.
